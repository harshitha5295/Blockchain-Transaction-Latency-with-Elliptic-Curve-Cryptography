# Blockchain-Transaction-Latency-with-Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography
This project analyzes transaction latency in a blockchain environment, specifically focusing on how different block sizes and block creation frequencies affect transaction processing times. The study is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts and the Hardhat development framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **NPM**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js, but you can also install it separately.
3. **Hardhat**: Install Hardhat globally by running:
